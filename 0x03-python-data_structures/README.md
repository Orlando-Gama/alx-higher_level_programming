Project Name; 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

0. Print a list of integers
mandatory
Write a function that prints all integers of a list.

Prototype: def print_list_integer(my_list=[]):
1. Secure access to an element in a list
mandatory
Write a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.

Prototype: def element_at(my_list, idx):
If idx is negative, the function should return None
2. Replace element
mandatory
Write a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).

Prototype: def replace_in_list(my_list, idx, element):
3. Print a list of integers... in reverse!
mandatory
Write a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.

Prototype: def print_reversed_list_integer(my_list=[]):
Format: one integer per line. See example
You are not allowed to import any module
You can assume that the list only contains integers
You are not allowed to cast integers into strings
You have to use str.format() to print integers
4. Replace in a copy
mandatory
Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).

Prototype: def new_in_list(my_list, idx, element):
If idx is negative, the function should return a copy of the original list
5. Can you C me now?
mandatory
Write a function that removes all characters c and C from a string.

Prototype: def no_c(my_string):
The function should return the new string
You are not allowed to import any module
You are not allowed to use str.replace()
6. Lists of lists = Matrix
7. Tuples addition
mandatory
Write a function that adds 2 tuples.

Prototype: def add_tuple(tuple_a=(), tuple_b=()):
8. More returns!
mandatory
Write a function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.

Prototype: def multiple_returns(sentence):
If the sentence is empty, the first character should be equal to None
9. Find the max
10. Only by 2
mandatory
Write a function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.

Prototype: def divisible_by_2(my_list=[]):
11. Delete at
12. Switch
mandatory
Complete the source code in order to switch value of a and b
13. Linked list palindrome
mandatory
Technical interview preparation:

You are not allowed to google anything
Whiteboard first
14. CPython #0: Python lists
#advanced
CPython is the reference implementation of the Python programming language. Written in C, CPython is the default and most widely used implementation of the language.
Since we now know a bit of C, we can look at what is happening under the hood of Python. Let’s have fun with Python and C, and let’s look at what makes Python so easy to use.
