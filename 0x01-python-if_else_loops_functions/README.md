8. To uppercase
9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important
mandatory

12. Fizz Buzz
13. Insert in sorted linked list
Write a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.

Return: the address of the new node, or NULL if it failed
14. Smile in the mirror
15. Remove at position
#advanced
Write a function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n (not the Python way, the “C array index”).
